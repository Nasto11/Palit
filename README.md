# Palit
This is a bot completely written by me (:D)
Im trying to learn d.py and Python at the same time.
# Requirements 
Python 3.5 and better.

You need to create a .json file called credentials.

```js
{
    "token": "token",
    "client_id": "id"
}
```
Copy the above to the file and in token field put the bot token and in client_id put your discord id.
# Running
Just clone the repo and run the palit.py
